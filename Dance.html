        <p>Definition:</p>
        Dance is a performing art form consisting of sequences of movement, 
        
        either improvised or purposefully selected. 
        
        This movement has aesthetic and often symbolic value. 
        
        Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, 
        
        by its repertoire of movements, 
        
        or by its historical period or place of origin.
